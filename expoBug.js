This error typically occurs when using the Expo CLI to manage a React Native project and involves issues with the project's configuration, dependencies, or build process.  A common symptom is an unexpected crash or failure during `expo start`, `expo build`, or other CLI commands. The error message itself might be vague or point to a seemingly unrelated problem.  Debugging often involves checking package versions, ensuring correct configuration files (like `app.json` or `package.json`), and examining the full error log for clues.
