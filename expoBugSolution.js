The solution to uncommon Expo CLI errors is highly dependent on the specific error encountered.  Generally, the debugging process involves the following:

1. **Examine the complete error log:**  Don't just focus on the headline error; look at the stack trace and other details for clues.
2. **Check `package.json` and `app.json`:** Verify dependencies and configurations for inconsistencies or missing items. Ensure version compatibility.
3. **Clean the cache:** Run `expo start --clear` or similar commands to clear the Expo cache.
4. **Check for dependency conflicts:** Use tools like `npm ls` or `yarn why` to inspect the dependency tree for conflicts or outdated packages.
5. **Update dependencies:** Run `expo upgrade` and ensure all packages are up-to-date.  If the error points to a specific dependency, update that one.
6. **Test in a fresh project:** Create a new Expo project and move your code incrementally to isolate the problem.
7. **Reinstall native modules:** If native modules are involved, remove and reinstall them.
8. **Search for similar errors:** Check online forums, the Expo documentation, and other resources for similar issues and solutions.
